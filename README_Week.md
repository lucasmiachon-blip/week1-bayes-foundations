## README\_Week.md — 7‑day plan (video‑first)

**Goal:** Build algebra → probability → Bayes for EBM, while setting up README, bookmarks, Anki, Quarto.

**Daily cadence (45–75 min):**

* 10–15 min: Algebra refresh
* 15–25 min: Probability/Bayes for clinicians
* 10–15 min: Programming basics (R or Python)
* 5–10 min: Tooling (README, Quarto, Bookmarks, Anki)

### Day 1

* Algebra: variables, solving one‑ and two‑step equations.
* Bayes/EBM: probabilities vs odds; pretest vs post‑test.
* Programming: RStudio basics (console, script, Run).
* Tooling: Create repo `week1-bayes-foundations` with the files from this pack. Enable 2FA on GitHub.

### Day 2

* Algebra: linear functions, slope, intercept; function notation.
* Bayes/EBM: sensitivity, specificity, LR+, LR−; Fagan nomogram.
* Programming: Python basics (print, variables, input).
* Tooling: Bookmarks folders + pin course links; Anki install check.

### Day 3

* Algebra → exponents and **logarithms** (10‑base, natural log); change‑of‑base.
* Bayes/EBM: Bayes’ rule formula; convert between probability and odds.
* Programming: R vectors and basic types; `c()`, `length()`, indexing.
* Tooling: Quarto “Hello, Quarto” doc render to HTML.

### Day 4

* Algebra: powers and roots; polynomials overview.
* Bayes/EBM: LR to post‑test probability (worked examples).
* Programming: Python lists, `for` loops; simple input → compute BMI.
* Tooling: README polishing with headings and links.

### Day 5

* Probability: sample spaces, events, complement, union/intersection.
* Bayes/EBM: base‑rate fallacy; screening test paradox.
* Programming: R data frames; read a CSV; compute proportions.
* Tooling: Anki deck “Bayes‑EBM Core” with 10 new cards.

### Day 6

* Probability: discrete pmf, expectation (intuition), variance (intuition).
* Bayes/EBM: prior, likelihood, posterior (language only, no calculus).
* Programming: Python dicts; mini quiz app reading LRs from a dict.
* Tooling: Quarto minimal handout `bayes-fagan.qmd` with one example.

### Day 7

* Integration: solve 3 diagnostic vignettes with pretest → post‑test.
* Programming: choose R or Python and redo one vignette in code.
* Tooling: Ship: push repo with all READMEs + a rendered Quarto HTML.
