
**Sequence**

1. Variables and linear equations (solve for x)
2. Functions: f(x), slope, intercept; read graphs
3. Exponents and scientific notation
4. Logarithms: definition, ln vs log10; change‑of‑base
5. Percentages ↔ decimals; probability vs odds

**Checkpoint questions**

* Solve: 3x + 5 = 20
* If f(x)=2x+1, what is f(3)?
* Convert 0.2 to odds; convert odds 3 to probability
* If p=0.1 and LR+=8, compute post‑test probability

**Tip**: when stuck, write steps; avoid mental math; check with calculator.
