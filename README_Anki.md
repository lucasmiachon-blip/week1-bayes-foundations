Definition (cloze)

Text: “Bayes’ rule: posterior odds = prior odds × LR.”

Cloze example: “posterior {{c1::odds}} = prior {{c1::odds}} × {{c1::likelihood ratio}}.”

Computation

Q: “Pretest 20%; LR+ = 4. What is post‑test probability?”

A: Convert 0.20 → odds 0.25; 0.25×4 = 1.0 odds → prob 1/(1+1)=0.50.

Concept check

Q: “Difference: probability vs odds?”

A: p = successes/total; odds = p/(1−p).

Vocabulary

Q: “What is LR− and how is it used?”

A: LR− = (1−sens)/spec. Multiplies prior odds to get posterior odds for a negative test.
